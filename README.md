# Express JS Note Taker 

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to take the given starter code and create the proper routes and functions to have the backend interact with the frontend.  We were given starter HTML, javascript and CSS.  I downloaded all the proper dependencies including node and express.  The routes folder was created to contain the htmlRoutes and apiRoutes.  htmlRoutes get requests to display the index.html and notes.html pages.  While the apiRoutes made three seperate requests(get, post, and delete) to allow the actual function of the note taker app to work.  My biggest hurdle was not naming the array in db.json, without that the save button wouldnt work. Also, figuring out the correct syntax for the deleteNote function took me a while, but it should work.
